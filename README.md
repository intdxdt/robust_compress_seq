# robust_compress_seq
Compress a non-overlapping increasing sequence.  
This does not normalize the sequence, but can be useful in some situations.  
Based on:

Jonathan Shewchuk, ["Adaptive precision floating-point arithmetic and fast robust predicates for computational geometry"](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/robust.html)
